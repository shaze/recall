##Workflows

* simplecall.nf

  This does the calling using `deepvariant`. NB relies on singularity.

   ` nextflow run -c baylor.config simplecall.nf -profile singularity,slurm`


*  glnexus.nf

   Takes input from gvcfs and does joint calling. I did from the joint directory.

## Files

* build38sex.map: shows biological sex of all individuals

## Directories

* joint: this is the directory in which I ran the jointcalling

  So `nextflow run ../glnexus.nf -profile slurm`

  See the config files

  * jointclean : the resulting bcfs
